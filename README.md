# library-book
A Java project with multiple class
The small Library has few Books and Patrons, the Main class asks a visistor to enter what book he/she is after and tells whether the library has that book in collection (and also current availibility) or not, it also asks for the name of the visitor and confirms if that vistor is a patron or not.
